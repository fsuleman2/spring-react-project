library used in course-app:
1)Reactstrap for using bootsrap like UI components
2)React-toastify for giving notificatons or toast
3)React-axios for performing get,post,put & delete request.

import{
Card,
CardBody,
CardTitle,
CardSubtitle,
CardText,
CardFooter,
Button,
Container
} from "reactstrap";

life cycle of React component works in class based
DidMount() //for adding component
DidUpdate()
DidUnamout()

But in functional component so we have to use Hook's

useState()
useEffect() //similar to DidMount() and DidUpdate
useEffect() loads first then page will be rendered
